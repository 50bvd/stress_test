## This is a simple script to stress your machine.
Start by making it executable with the following command:
`chmod +x stress_test.sh`
Then execute it with the following command:
`./stress_test.sh`
_NOTE: What made me create this script was the deployment of a Zabbix server, I had to stress my VM's to see if my triggers worked._
