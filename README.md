## This is a simple script to stress your machine.
Start by making it executable with the following command:

`chmod +x stress_test.sh`

Then execute it with the following command:

`./stress_test.sh`

_NOTE: What made me create this script was the deployment of a Zabbix server, I had to stress my Linux VM's to see if my triggers worked._
